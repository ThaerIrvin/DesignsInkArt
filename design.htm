		<p>Unlike any of the books in the framing industry <i>The Principles of Framing Design</i> begins with traditional Design 101 concepts, but reconfigures them to fit within the structure of picture framing. Never before has a design manual redefined  the aspects of line, color, and texture into the elements that make up framing design including mats, moulding and layout.</p>
		<p>Written for serious custom frame designers and those interested in designing for competition. Chapter-by-chapter discussions include in depth discussions of the elements of line, color, texture, shape, intensity, and space; and the factors of rhythm, proportion, balance, emphasis, and unity to form the palette of principles that make up design.</p>
		<p>Broken into four sections, it covers the five stages of the design process; all elements and factors of design, as individual chapters; designing for competition; computer designing; and placement of wall hangings.</p>
		<p>This newest release from <b>Designs Ink Publishing</b>, will be laminated, soft cover, 176 page edition, 7&quot;x 9&quot;, price TBA, as it may be released as an e-Book.  The book is written in essay format, but includes line art, diagrams, tips, glossary, contents, appendix, plus complete and extensive index and bibliography.</p>
