    		<p><b>JCM Corporation</b></p>
    		<p>This Japanese corporation located in Las Vegas wanted four large collectable original pieces of art for their newly built feng shui designed foyer of their new headquarters. I was commissioned to create these four 4'x8'&nbsp; layered tile pieces using resist for the background of the Japanese characters of Love, Peace, Prosperity and Harmony.</p>
			<p>Numerous abstracted layers of words were applied and finally topped with a single bold line Calligraphy was done with a 6&quot; horse hair Sumi brush and Swiss walnut ink. The pieces were designed and created per the client request as very contemporary, abstract, and illegible. They were painted on 260# Arches HP watercolor paper, then framed in 3&quot; deep acrylic boxes.</p>
