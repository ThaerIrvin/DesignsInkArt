		<h1>Single Stroke - Diptych</h1>
		<p>12&quot; x12&quot; each</p>
		<p>One large bold horizontal single stroke was made using a large sumi brush on heavy 140# rough watercolor paper of varying sizes on Arches 90# hot press watercolor paper. Each frame has two freeform hand cut and wrapped mats using thin mulberry paper and a single 4-ply mat, all assembled with spacers between to create added depth.<br>
		Additional sumi brush strokes were continued up onto the wrapped mats for a totally interactive composition.<br> 
		Frame is a 1-1/2" deep matte black lacquer with soft curve stem design.</p>
		<p>This type of framing may only be done with the express consent of the artist; as a collabortive venture between artist and framer; or, as in this case, by the artist alone...also a skilled framer.</p>
		<p>These are sold only as framed diptych, priced at $750.00 for the pair</p>
