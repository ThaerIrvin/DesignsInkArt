	<p>Welcome to the homepage of Chris Paschke and Designs Ink, specializing in fine art originals, art licensing, notecards, greeting cards, prints and open edition reproductions. The following pages and gallery will introduce you to the operations, original art, and licensing of Chris Paschke as an innovative contemporary abstract expressionist, Asian and floral artist, calligrapher, figurative painter, encaustic artist, and graphic designer.</p>

	<p><a href="gallery.shtml" target="_blank">Fine Art Gallery</a></p>

	<p>The above link takes you to the <b>Gallery</b> page which features tiles as links to smaller themed galleries, or simply use the <i>Art</i> menu list above to narrow down your search. All of the <b>Chris Paschke</b> art in the <b>Galleries</b> are originals, though some are also available as retail open edition reproductions from Wild Apple as seen in the <a href="prints.shtml">Prints Gallery</a>. Contact us directly for information on out-of-print Wild Apple prints as many are still available exclusively from Designs Ink as new images. Many Paschke originals are also available as Print-on-Demand (POD) giclee images offered on fine art paper or canvas from assorted internet companies. The links below will take you to many of them or visit the Links page for many additional internet resources at <a href="links.shtml">Links</a>. And for licensing opportunities contact Chris Paschke directly at the numbers below.</p>

	<p><a href="framedprints.shtml" target="_blank">Framed Prints</a></p>

	<p>Most of the originals on this site may also be converted into a single print, pair, or set of matted, framed small images of your choice for $30.00 each. The above link takes you to the <b>Framed Prints</b> page which gives a sampling of currently framed pieces. Email us with questions or special requests. These are perfect as gifts and many of these small framed prints are available at Gallery 'N' Gifts, Tehachapi CA.</p>

	<p>In this era of twittering and sending emails, the art and sentiment behind the sending of a personally hand-written notecard is fast becoming a very special and unique gift. Nearly all of the original art shown in the galleries on this site may be custom printed into 4-Â¼" x 5-1/2" fine art Chris Paschke cards to fit your desires. Cards are blank inside so they may be individually personalized to fit any occasion, and all individual cards and sets are protected by clear protective sleeves. Both A2 and A6 cards are sold individually for retail prices of $3.95 each, as sets of four for $13.95, six for $19.95 or eight for $24.95. Images may be selected to complete your set. Wholesale prices are available upon request, some assortment limitations may apply. Email us for additional information <a href="mailto:info@designsinkart com">info@designsinkart.com</a></p>
