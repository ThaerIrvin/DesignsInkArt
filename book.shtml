	<p>Designs Ink Publishing was founded in 1997 in order to promote the educational expertise of educators in the picture framing industry. Currently the publications printed by us have been targeting the trade only, though there are many aspects of them that touch the needs of artist/framers and craftspeople alike.</p>

    <img style="margin-left: 5%; max-width: 90%;" src="images/Author.gif" alt="Chris A. Paschke, CPF GCF">
  
	<p>A second generation professional picture framer (since 1970) Chris received CPF (Certified Picture Framer) status from the Professional Picture Framers Association (PPFA) in 1986 and GCF (Guild Commended Framer) status from Fine Art Trade Guild (FATG) 1997 in England.</p>

	<p>Chris has been chair of the PPFA Competition Board since 2003 and continues to work on continuing education and assorted committees in an advisory capacity. She remains on both the PPFA and PFM faculties and her ongoing industry affiliations include ANSI, ASTM, FATG, Larson-Juhl, Hobby Publications, PMA, Nielsen Bainbridge, Artaissance, Roma Home Decor, and Wild Apple Graphics.</p>
	  
	<p>She has been Technical Mounting Editor for <u>Picture Framing Magazine</u> since 1991, featuring her monthly column &quot;Mastering Mounting&quot;. Her first book <i>The Mounting And Laminating Handbook</i>, was published in August 1997. The second edition was launched August 2002, and her third edition is currently available through this website having hit market shelves in March 2008. Chris is a well known creative framing designer, author, educator and consultant who lectures, and demonstrates at industry events around the country. Though she teaches competition judging, as well as principles of framing layout and design, she specializes in mounting, laminating and creative matting techniques. Her innovative book, <i>Creative Mounting, Wrapping, and Laminating </i>was released at the West Coast Art and Framing Show, January 2003. Her first design book <i>Principles of Framing Design</i> was put on hold but is currently being considered as an eBook or PDF release rather than a bound version. There are numerous articles about framing design in our Design Princliples section of the library, Articles by Subject. <a href="library.shtml">Library</a></p>
	  
	<p>Available publications include all three books currently in print from Chris A. Paschke, CPF GCF.</p>
