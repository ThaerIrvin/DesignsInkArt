		<p>The character is written using black ink on mulberry paper in Kaishu script.<br>It is the common form currently used in everyday printing and signage. Both the intricate, complicated traditional stroke pattern as well as the modified, simpler version with fewer strokes are illustrated here. This style is a controlled, slowly written structured style that works well with anything that needs an Asian touch.</p>  
		<p>It may be scanned as an overlay, used as a background, or digitally collaged.</p>
